# CSE412-Project
To use the Project
Download our Project from Github by cloning or just downloading the zip file. Which you then open up in your editor or terminal. Where the structure would look something like this
Next we need to set up the PostgreSQL files into your own device where you can open PgAdmin or PSQL. Create a DB named music_library and using the query tool run the script located in database/database.sql which should populate all the tables and schemas.
Then for the backend, copy the .env-example file and rename it to .env and fill in your credentials ideally you would only need to fill in DB_User and DB_password.
Next for the backend install dependencies in the backend folder using npm install and run the server by either using npm run dev or npm start which should start the server on localhost. 
For the frontend go to the frontend file install the dependencies using npm install and start the server using npm start which should then show you our webpage. There are 2 demo accounts for you to use.
